# My IDE - Code Editor Project

Welcome to the My Code Editor project, a development effort focused on creating a lightweight and functional code editor. This project is currently in the early stages, but I am committed to evolving it into a powerful tool for developers.

## Features

- **Supported Languages:** The editor currently supports Python, C, C++, Java, and JavaScript, allowing for a versatile coding experience.
- **Future Plans:** I aim to develop a custom interpreter for this project, enhancing its functionality and making it a more comprehensive tool.
- **User-Centric Design:** The focus is on creating an editor that is not only powerful but also intuitive and easy to use.

## Upcoming Developments

I am actively working on expanding the capabilities of this editor. The future roadmap includes:

- Developing a custom interpreter to provide a more integrated coding experience.
- Continuously adding support for more programming languages.
- Enhancing the user interface for a more seamless development process.
